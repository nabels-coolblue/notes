# Integrating GitHub into Slack

This tutorial will show you how to integrate certain GitHub events (like new pull requests) into your Slack channels. 

### Notes for public

The links in this tutorial assume you're working for the same company as I do, so if you don't, be sure to replace coolblue in [http://coolblue.slack.com](http://coolblue.slack.com) with the name of your Slack environment.

## Setup Slack

1) Navigate to Slack's [apps and integrations](https://coolblue.slack.com/apps/manage). 

2) Go to the app called GitHub.
